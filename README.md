# Calculator-using-tkinter-lambda-expression-
This is a very basic project. However use of lambda function and eval function makes the project bit tricky and interesting as well.
Took me around few hours to build this project after gaining basic knowledge about tkinter widgets and organizing layouts. However ther are many other approaches to build the same kind of project. I find it interesting playing with lambda function.
